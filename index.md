### Thoughts on Programming Languages
I would probably have to say that up until this point `C++` is my favorite language right now. Some langauges that I have used include: `Java`, `Python`, and `System Verilog` among others.

Here are some examples of C++ libraries I tend to use often:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
```
